# Nullsite - A simple static site generator written in Python 
Nullsite is a simple static site generator written in Python, also used to create my blog. It's easy to use, simple and minimalist!
## Usage
1. Download this repository via `git clone`
2. Add your blogposts as markdown files to the posts/ folder (all .md files have a frontmatter that must be included)
3. Run `src/main.py` to build the site
Look at the examples provided to understand how Nullsite works
You must provide your own server to host the `index.html`. I'd recommend using the Live Server extension on VSCode.
